/* 
Building a tic tac toe game:

-Win condition (tie and win)
-build a board (possibly a table)
-Ask for player names (form)
-Create players
-Displaying whos turn is it.
-countinue to alternate players until win or tie
-user is not suppose to be able to click on already marked square
-Ability to reset the board without having to type player names again (possibly switch who starts first or who is x and o)
-after one player wins append his score on the scoreboard (somewhere on the side)

algorithm:
-make an area for players which is a square divided in 9 equal size smaller squares.
-players choose x or o and write their names next to them
-after filling the form players are assigned X or O
-Randomize which player is first
-when a player clicks one of the small squares on the board it is assigned the value of that player (X or O)
-Once a square is filled it cannot be changed
-After each fill check if any player has a full row or column or across assigned to him (that player wins) - stop the game
-if all the squares are filled and there is no winner its a tie
-after one of the players clicks the reset button it clears the board and randomizes which player is first
-append the score on the score board
